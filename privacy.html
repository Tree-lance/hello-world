        <h3 id="lawful-basis">Our lawful bases for processing your data</h3>

        <p>The lawful basis for which we process your data is for our legitimate interests and the legitimate interests of our customers.</p>

        <p>The purpose of Guaranteed Rent 2 Rent is:</p>

          <li>To allow us and our customers to follow up with you about leasing your property</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We understand that you have made your information available online in order to find a third-party to rent your property and we believe our intentions, which are to lease your property for a long-term period or connect you with someone interested in doing so, are in line with these aims.</p>

        <p>Processing the data in this way therefore helps to achieve the joint goals in a quicker and more efficient manor.</p>

        <h3 id="retention-periods">Our retention periods</h3>

        <p>The data collected is retained indefinitely. This is due to the fact that we will contact you for ourselves in an automated way no more than once and store this information to ensure we do not contact you in an automated way twice. This also allows us to check if we have contacted you in an automated way once before contacting you manually.</p>

      
        <h3 id="security">Security</h3>

        <p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>

        <h3 id="your-rights">Your rights</h3>

        <p>Under the lawful basis in which your data is being processed you have the following rights:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The right to be informed about how your data is being processed</li>
          <li>The right of access to your stored data</li>
          <li>The right to rectify your data</li>
          <li>The right to have your data erased</li>
          <li>The right to restrict the processing of your data</li>

          <li>The right to not be subject to automated decision-making including profiling</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you would like to exercise any of these rights you can do so with us by contacting us via email on Guaranteed-rent2rent@mail.com.</p>

        <p>We understand that you have made your information available online to allow third-parties interested in renting your property to enquire about them. Since these enquiries are expected, we believe providing all landlords with a link to our privacy notice with each enquiry we send, potentially increasing the number of SMS text messages sent, to be of disproportionate effort. We also believe that text messages containing links may cause simple enquiries to be misconstrued as marketing messages.</p>

        <p>Therefore, we believe directly providing you with this privacy notice would seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of the processing and would involve a disproportionate effort. According to the Information Commissioner's Office's (ICO's) "Guide to the General Data Protection Regulation", because of these reasons and the fact that we collect your information from external sources, we do not need to provide this privacy information to you directly. More information on this can be found using the link below.</p>

        <p>
          <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-be-informed/">https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-be-informed/</a>
        </p>

        <p>However, this privacy notice is available to you on our public website.</p>

        <p>We understand that this conflicts with a your right to be informed and have conducted a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for this reason. Our conclusion from this DPIA is that the level of the risks we identified with our processing ranged from low to medium risk.</p>

        
        <p>You also have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) if you believe there is a problem with the way we handle your data.</p>
