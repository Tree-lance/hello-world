            <h1>Who am I</h1>

            <p>Hi iâ€™m Jermaine,
              <br>
              <br>
              Welcome and thank you for visiting Guaranteed Rent 2 Rent. I hope from this page you will gain some knowledge and insight about myself and Guaranteed Rent 2 Rent. 
              <br>
              <br>
              By way of background I am a Legal Executive (FCILEx) and I specialise in Housing and Family law and have done so now since 2013. 
              <br>
              <br>
              I have always had a passion for property and with this in mind, I have decided to venture into the property management business. As I deal with Landlords and Tenants on an everyday basis representing them both, whether it's a landlord wanting possession of their property or a tenant complaining about the condition of their property, I am aware of the legal process for dealing with such matters.
              <br>
              <br>
              With my background I have decided to create Guaranteed Rent 2 Rent with the sole purpose of providing both Landlords and Tenants a professional service whilst also benefiting from my knowledge of the ever changing Housing laws.
              <br>
              <br>
               Guaranteed Rent 2 Rent is an established, family run Property Management Company.
              <br>
              <br>
              Our experience and professionalism combined with our extensive knowledge ensures that we provide a service that is second to none! We work with local businesses to house their professional employees and we specialise in placing professional and corporate tenants in high-quality shared houses (HMOs).
              <br>
              <br>
              We also take on properties and manage them on the behalf of the Landlord so they no longer have to deal directly with tenants. The accommodation that we provide are designed specifically for professionals seeking a room to rent on an individual assured shorthold tenancy agreement.
              <br>
              <br>
              Guaranteed Rent 2 Rent always strives to be fully up to date and legally compliant and is a forward looking business with a great solution for both Landlords and Tenants.
              <br>

              Experience teaches us that regular maintenance can easily escalate to a substantial cost for landlords. We have our own maintenance team who carry out free routine maintenance work on all the properties we manage.

              <br>
              All properties are visited every month ensuring the tenant is taking care of your property. Tenants are provided with an out-of-office emergency telephone number to deal with any emergencies which may arise.
